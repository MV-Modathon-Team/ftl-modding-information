Welcome to the wiki for the FTL modding information repository! Here you can find various guides and templates to learn how to mod FTL, Hyperspace and Multiverse.

Most of the guides on this repository assume that you'll be using Hyperspace, since it has the most potential for new and interesting mods. You can download the latest version of Hyperspace [here](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace/releases/latest), and you can find instructions for installing it [here](https://ftl-hyperspace.github.io/FTL-Hyperspace/). For help with installing, you can use the questions channel on the [Multiverse Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hhs5ecx).

The guides here also aim to be compatible with Multiverse, which can be downloaded [here](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35332).

## Modding Tools

There are a few applications you'll need before you start. For editing images, most FTL modders use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). If you're willing to buy or compile it, you could also use [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). For editing XML and Lua, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are the usual choices. If you want to make player or enemy ships, you can use the ship editor, [Superluminal](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=38322). For installing mods, use the latest version of [Slipstream](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17102).

## Where to Start

If you're completely new to FTL modding, there are a couple different places you could start depending on what you want to do. If you want to add a new player ship, start with the [Ship Creation Guide](Ship-Creation-Guide.md). For anything else, start with the [XML Guide](XML-Guide.md).
