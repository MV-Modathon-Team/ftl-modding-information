The vanilla assets can be extracted using Slipstream. First, make sure you have no other mods patched. If you have mods patched, you can restore the game to vanilla by pressing the Patch button in Slipstream without any mods selected. After that, go to File > Extract Dats.

A dialogue will appear allowing you to choose a folder to save the data to. Once you select the desired folder, press the Save button. If you did everything correctly, the folder you selected should now have the subfolders `audio`, `data`, `fonts` and `img`. These folders contain all the vanilla game assets and can be used for reference while modding.
